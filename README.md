# 📊 **EV Adoption in India (2014–2025) — Power BI Dashboard**

A complete data analysis project exploring **10+ years of Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption trends**, segment growth, and penetration patterns in India, presented through a clean, interactive **Power BI one-page dashboard**.

---

## 🔍 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes India's EV market using year-wise sales, segment-level data, and EV penetration percentages to uncover meaningful patterns in adoption.
The goal was to convert a large dataset into a **clear, engaging, and insight-rich dashboard**.

This project was created as part of a data visualization challenge focusing on **storytelling with data**.

---

## 🗂 **Dataset Description**

The dataset contains:

* **Years:** 2014–2025
* **Sales Quantity:** Total number of EVs sold yearly
* **Segments:**

  * High-speed electric 2-wheelers
  * Passenger 3-wheelers
  * Cargo 3-wheelers
  * Electric cars
  * Electric buses
* **EV Penetration (%):** EV share of overall vehicle sales
* **Categories:** Aggregated categories like 2W, 3W, 4W, etc.

This dataset is publicly available and sourced from EV industry reports and government data.

## 📈 **Key Trends & Insights**

### **1️⃣ EV Sales Grew Nearly 50× in 10 Years**

EV adoption accelerated massively, especially after 2019, marking a strong exponential growth phase.

### **2️⃣ High-Speed e2Ws Lead the EV Revolution**

Post-2020, high-speed electric scooters/bikes dominate EV sales — showing a shift towards reliable, everyday commuter EVs.

### **3️⃣ Passenger 3Ws Are the Backbone of Commercial EV Adoption**

Steady year-on-year growth indicates strong adoption by shared mobility, auto-rickshaws, and last-mile delivery.

### **4️⃣ Cars & Buses Contribute Very Little**

Despite media hype, 4W and bus EVs form a small share — India’s EV revolution is **2W + 3W driven**, not car-driven.

### **5️⃣ EV Penetration Rising but Still Low (~22%)**

While sales exploded, penetration remains modest → **India is in the early adoption stage** with massive future potential.

## ⭐ **Original Finding (Beyond Surface-Level)**

Even though EV sales grew rapidly (50× growth), overall EV penetration remains only ~22%.
This mismatch suggests:

* EV growth is **exponential but still early-stage**
* India has **not entered the maturity phase** of the EV S-curve
* HUGE market potential remains, especially in personal 4Ws and public transport

This insight only becomes clear when combining **sales trends + penetration data**, not by looking at either alone.
