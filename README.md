# 📊 **EV Adoption in India (2014–2025) — Power BI Dashboard**

This project analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption trends in India using a decade of sales, segment-wise distribution, and EV penetration data.
It converts a large dataset into a **clear, visual, and insight-driven one-page Power BI dashboard**.

---

## 🗂 **Dataset Selected & Why It Matters**

The dataset contains:

* **Years:** 2014–2025
* **EV Sales Quantity:** Total EVs sold each year
* **Segments:**

  * High-speed Electric 2-Wheelers
  * Passenger 3-Wheelers
  * Cargo 3-Wheelers
  * Electric Cars
  * Electric Buses
* **EV Penetration (%):** EV share of all vehicle sales

### ✔ Why it’s relevant

India is undergoing a major transition to clean mobility.
Studying sales, segments, and penetration helps understand:

* Market behavior
* Growth drivers
* Adoption barriers
* Future opportunity

## 📈 **Key Trends & Insights**

### **1️⃣ EV Sales Grew Nearly 50× (2014–2025)**

India’s EV market shows explosive exponential growth, especially after FY-2020.

### **2️⃣ High-Speed e2Ws Are Driving the Revolution**

They account for the majority of EV growth, driven by subsidies and urban mobility needs.

### **3️⃣ Passenger e3Ws Are the Core of Commercial Electrification**

Auto-rickshaws and shared mobility continue strong year-on-year growth.

### **4️⃣ 4-Wheelers & Buses Still Form a Small Share**

India’s EV market is **2W + 3W dominated**, not car-dominated.

### **5️⃣ EV Penetration Rose From 0.5% → 22%**

Strong growth, yet still early in the adoption curve.

## ⭐ **Original Finding (Beyond Surface-Level)**

> **Despite sales growing 50×, EV penetration is still only ~22%.**
> This mismatch shows India is **still in the early adoption phase**, with massive untapped potential in 4-wheelers and public transport.
> The full S-curve adoption has **not yet begun**, meaning the next decade will see the real transformation.
